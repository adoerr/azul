## Motivation

<br>

<i>"What I cannot create, I do not understand."</i>

The above quote from Richard P. Feynman says it all. This repo is a place to create and understand while learning things.

More precisely it is mostly about playing around with Bluetooth and the [Ubertooth One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/ubertoothone/) gadget.
